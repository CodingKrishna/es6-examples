// user.js

// By default anything you declare in a file in a ES6 project is not available outside that file.
// You have to use the export keyword to explicitly make it available. Hereâ€™s an example of how to export a user class.

var localVariable = 123;    // Not visible outside this file
export default function User(age) {
    this.age = age;
} // Can be imported by other files.


// user-details.js

// And now if we wanted to use the User class in another file

import User from 'user';
var testUser = new User(35);
